# Bid-Master

## 📚 Project Description

This is a simple **Python-based bidding/auction system** developed as a learning project.  
The program allows multiple users to place bids, stores the bids securely, and automatically identifies the highest bidder at the end of the auction.

It is designed to practice Python concepts such as loops, dictionaries, functions, and user interaction through the command line.

## 🎯 Features
- Accepts bids from multiple participants.
- Prevents loss of previous bids.
- Identifies and announces the highest bidder.
- Clean and simple terminal interface.
- Beginner-friendly and easy to customize.


## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- No external libraries — only built-in Python modules.


## 🙌 Acknowledgment
This project was created as part of my Python learning journey to strengthen my understanding of loops, dictionaries, and basic input/output in Python.
